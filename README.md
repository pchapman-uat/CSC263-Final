# CSC263 Final | RPG Simulator

## Description
This project is a standard Role Playing Game (RPG) simulator. The user will be able to choose their name, color, and difficulty, then they will fight a variety of enemies. The more waves you complete the higher your score will be. All scores are added to a local database, allowing you to see your ranking.

## SQLite 3
This project uses SQLite 3 to store the high-score data. The database is stored in the project folder. To connect to the local database the SQLite 3 driver `sqlite-jdbc-3.45.2.0` and the framework `slf4j-api-1.7.36`. Information on these can be found on the SQlite JDBC Driver [GitHub](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc).
